                Priyank Panchal is a strong candidate for captaincy for the India A team that will take on the visiting New Zealand A side in September. 
                Having previously led the A side to South Africa last year, the Gujarat opener is expected to be entrusted with the responsibility once again. Sources have revealed to Cricbuzz, that in the unlikely event of the 32-year-old missing out on the series for any reason, Hanuma Vihari is the next potential captaincy candidate.
                 Panchal is currently at the NCA in Bengaluru.
